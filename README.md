# WWComposer-Public

This is a copy of the in-house tool I made to create the playable texts for WordWhile.  You enter a text and then can enter challenge words in one of two categories (Silly or Trick) for each word in the original text.



TO DO:

- reimplement Global edits (apply a given challenge to all occurences of a given word in the text)
- improve text browser (currently, all the texts in the DB available for editing are added to a pull down menu widget that appears when you click Open)
- users and permissions, security, checks on file size


N.B. This copy is broken: all the information to access the MySQL DB has been redacted.
